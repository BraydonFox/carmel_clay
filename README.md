# Carmel Curbside History: A Self-Guided Walking Tour Application
An interactive look at the history of Carmel, Indiana. Created using WordPress, PHP, and AngularJS.
Made possible by a collaboration between Ball State University's Department of History and The Carmel Clay Historical Society.

I provided the original application and basic structure as seen within this repository. The application was designed to easily grow
and be expanded as the client wished. Changes made by the client include a new introductory menu, more historic locations,
and the addition of more voiceover lines to accompany those sites.

The live site can be viewed <a href="https://www.carmelcurbsidehistory.org/">here</a>.
